## Features

- **Geocoding**:
    - Convert an address to a latitude and longitude (forward geocoding)
    - Convert a latitude and longitude to an address (reverse geocoding)
  - Support via native Android/iOS services
  - Support via third party APIs for all platforms (planned)
- **Geolocation**: (planned)
    - Get the current location of the device
    - Monitor the location of the device

## Artifacts

This library includes the following artifacts:

| Artifact                  | Status  |
|---------------------------|:-------:|
| `compass-geocoder-core`   |   üöß    |
| `compass-geocoder-mobile` |   üöß    |
| `compass-geocoder-web`    |   üöß    |
| `compass-geolocation`     | planned |

### `compass-geocoder-mobile`

This artifact uses built-in services for both iOS and Android. That means that there is restrictions
to its usage. See
the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder) as
well as the [iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clgeocoder)
for more information.

You can be throttled or blocked from using the geocoding services if you make too many requests in a
short period of time.

### Platforms

The artifacts are designed to work on the following platforms:

| Artifact                      | Android | iOS | Desktop (jvm) | Native | Browser (wasm) |

## Setup

You can add this library to your project using Gradle.

### Version Catalog

In `libs.versions.toml`:

```toml
[versions]
compass = "0.1.0"

[libraries]
compass-geocoder = { module = "dev.jordond.compass:compass-geocoder", version.ref = "compass" }
```

To add to a multiplatform project, add the dependency to the common source-set:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.compass.core)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
