# üìç Overview

Geolocation includes the following features:

* Track a user's location
* Get the current location
* Customize the accuracy of the tracking

{% hint style="info" %}
As of right now Compass does **not** provide any permissions related support. So before using geolocation services, make sure you handle the permissions yourself. \

In the future Compass may add support for handling permissions, but it is not yet planned.
