# ðŸ§­ Compass

## Overview

Compass is a Kotlin Multiplatform library location toolkit. It provides a set of tools for working with location data, including geocoding, reverse geocoding, and more. The library is built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, providing a straightforward API for geocoding operations.

### Features

* Forward and Reverse Geocoding
  * Native support for Android and iOS
  * Support for other platforms by using web based APIs
    * Included support for [Google Maps ](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding)and [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/#search)
* Geolocation _(planned)_
* Testable
  * Compass' API is built around interfaces and is easily injected or customized
* Extensible
  * If a wrapper for a web based API service isn't available, it's easy to write your own

### Easy to use

Compass has a simple API:

```kotlin
suspend fun lookupCoordinates(latitude: Double, longitude: Double): Place? {
    val geocoder = Geocoder()
    val result: GeocoderResult<Place> = geocoder.reverse(latitude, longitude)
    return result.getOrNull()
}
```

The above `Geocoder()` function is one of many extension functions included to make your life easier.  Behind the scenes a `PlatformGeocoder` is used to do all the heavy lifting, and can be created and provided on a per-platform basis.

The above `Geocoder()`extension function is from the Android/iOS only artifact. If you plan on supporting other platforms, check out [mixed-platforms.md](usage/mixed-platforms.md "mention").
