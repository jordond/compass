### Custom Geocoder API

Compass includes a template module: `compass-geocoder-web-template`

If there is a Geocoding Web API that you would wish to add to Compass, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:jordond/compass`
2. Make a copy of the `compass-geocoder-web-template` module
3. Rename the copy to match the web service you're adding:
   1. ex: `compass-geocoder-web-myapi`
4. Search for the word "Template" in the module and replace it with your service name
5. Implement the `HttpApiPlatformGeocoder` interface
6. Customize the URL, query parameters, and the response models
7. Implement the `ForwardEndpoint` and `ReverseEndpoint`
8. Finish the implementation
9. Run `./gradlew apiDump` and commit the changes
10. Push & open a Pull Request
